# CSC510 Analysis Of Algorithms 
Welcome to Analysis of Algorithms!. Please modify this README file with the following info:

***IMPORTANT: You must add your student info below right after you create your class repository.
Failure to do that will result in your repository being deleted, and you will be dropped from
this class during the first week of instruction due to student's inactivity***

Email:  ecenario@mail.sfsu.edu

***IMPORTANT: Every time you finish an algorithm challenge you must set the corresponding
assignment to 'completed' in the following table of assignments. Failure to do it will result in
your assignment not being graded. Take into consideration that this table of assignments is the
first thing I check before grading an algorithm challenge. If after the deadline of the assignment, the 
column for that assignment is set to not completed, I will assume that you haven't submitted it***


| Assignment       |     C/NC      |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| AC1              | completed     |
| AC2              | completed     |
| AC3              | completed     |
| AC4              | completed     |
| AC5              | completed     |
| AC6 (EC)         | completed     |
| Extracredit      | completed     |


## Please read carefully all the assignments guidelines described in this README file. Failure to follow them, may affect negatively your grade.

# Algorithm Challenges General Guidelines:

* In this class students will implement six algorithm challenges. 

* Algorithm challenge #6 is optional and it is 5% extracredit. No partial credit
will be given for this assignment

* Algorithm challenges are individual work. However, group work is encouraged to help other students. 
  In addition, the instructor will help if a students are stuck or need help with assignments.

* Students will be given more than enough time to complete all the assignments in 
this class. No extensions for algorithm challenge will be granted unless there are 
  compelling AND document reasons to do so, or the student
  previously has arranged accommodations with the instructor AND this student is
  registered into the DPRC. 

* Algorithm challenges are graded based on good the hard work done by the student
in the assignment rather than in the correct solution to the problem. I am more 
  interested on how students take different approaches to solve the problem.

* Each algorithm challenge has its own specific instructions. Read them carefully

* Failure to follow the algorithm challenges policies or rules may affect negatively your grade.

# Submissions General Guidelines:

* Each folder in this repository contains a pdf document with all the guidelines for algorithm challenges. All your work 
must be done in a new pdf file. 
  
* Submissions go to their respective folder. For example, if you finish algorithm challenge #1, then is must be pushed to ac1 folder. 

* Pseudocode provided in algorithm challenges must be done in LaTeX and the compiled PDF representing the pseudocode MUST 
be embedded to your work. DO NOT submit the LaTeX code for your pseudocode, I only need the compiled pdf version of your
  pseudocode
